# vim-kami

vim-kami is a syntax highlighting plugin for vim. Simply add it using vim-plug to get kami syntax highlighting on all `.km` files.

This plugin is pretty incomplete so far, and I have no idea how to complete most of it, so PRs are appreciated.

For the KAMI spec, check [the parser's](https://github.com/lilith-in-starlight/kami-parser/) readme.
